### Bug: Missing Top Border When Walls Are Enabled
**Description:**  
When the "Walls" option was enabled, a yellow border was displayed around the game area to indicate the walls. However, the top border (directly beneath the score header) was missing, causing the wall to appear incomplete.

---

#### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start the game and enable the "Walls" option in the options menu.
2. Observe the game board‚Äîyellow borders appear on the sides and bottom, but the top border under the score header is missing.

---

#### Cause:
The top border was not being drawn explicitly as part of the game canvas rendering. The border logic did not account for the area beneath the score header.

---

#### Resolution:
To resolve the issue:
1. Added a block in the `drawGame` function to explicitly draw a 3px border under the score header.
2. Dynamically updated the border color based on the "Walls" state:
   - Yellow (`#f9ca24`) when walls are enabled.
   - Dark gray (`#2C2C42`) when walls are disabled.

---

#### Relevant Code Snippet:
**Before Fixing:**
```javascript
gameCtx.fillStyle = "white";
gameCtx.font = "40px Verdana";
gameCtx.fillText(score, tileSize, tileSize * 2.25); // Draw the score
```

**After Fixing:**
```javascript
// Draw the 3px border under the header
if (wallsEnabled) {
    gameCtx.fillStyle = "#f9ca24"; // Yellow border for walls enabled
} else {
    gameCtx.fillStyle = "#2C2C42"; // Green neon background color for walls disabled
}
gameCtx.fillRect(0, tileSize * 3, gameCanvas.width, 3); // Draw the border
```
