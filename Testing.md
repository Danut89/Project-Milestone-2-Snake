## The principles of automated and manual testing

**Automated Testing:**  
Automated tests provide fast, repeatable, and consistent validation of our application's functionality. They are ideal for regression, performance, and load testingâ€”scenarios where frequent, high-volume checks are needed and human error must be minimized. This approach is especially effective in CI/CD environments, where rapid feedback on code changes is crucial.

**Manual Testing:**  
Manual testing leverages human insight to explore and evaluate aspects that automated tests might overlook, such as usability and overall user experience. It is best used for exploratory testing, UI/UX assessments, and complex scenarios that require contextual judgment. This method ensures that the application not only works correctly but also meets real-world usability standards.

## Future Testing Plans  

- **Add Unit Tests**: Use Jest or Mocha to test individual JavaScript functions (e.g., snake movement, food generation).  
- **Browser Automation Testing**: Implement automated browser tests using Selenium or Cypress for menu navigation and gameplay.  
- **Performance Profiling**: Test the game with heavy animations or large data sets to ensure smooth rendering.  

## User Feedback  

The game was tested with a small group of users to gather feedback on:  
- **Gameplay Responsiveness**: Controls were smooth, and pause/resume functionality worked well.  
- **Accessibility**: Users with keyboard-only navigation confirmed all features were accessible.  
- **Visual Design**: Users appreciated the high-contrast visuals and animated buttons.

**Future Improvement**: Incorporate additional suggestions like customizable game themes.
